Hello John!
I am in New York and I can not find Ben and Jenny.
It is been a long time since I last saw them.
We are staying in Nando's house.
Tomorrow it is going to rain, so I will not leave the house. But I am so excited to explore the city.
We are loving it and we will probably return home a little heavier. 
We should be eating healthier. 
Please tell them we tried to reach. We should have had contacted them before coming here. I would be happy if you did. Thanks for everything.
