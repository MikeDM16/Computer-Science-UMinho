Hello John!
I'm in New York and I can't find Ben and Jenny.
It's been a long time since I last saw them.
We're staying in Nando's house.
Tomorrow it's going to rain, so I won't leave the house. But I'm so excited to explore the city.
We're loving it 'n' we'll probably return home a little heavier. 
We should be eating healthier. 
Please tell'em we tried to reach. We should've had contacted them before coming here. I'd be happy if you did. Thanks for everything.
