# Computer Science UMinho - Course material and main projects

![UMLogo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MikeDM16/Computer-Science-UMinho/master/Mestrado_MSc/logo.png "UMLogo")

During my student years at University of Minho, while taking my Master degree in Software Engineering, I gathered around lots of exercises, tutorials, investigation resources and interesting projects. 

I finally decided to organize everything in a single repository mapping all the projects. 
Since some of the course contents are similar over the years, this collection of information may be useful for other students or someone interested in the project's topics. 

Because all the code here is student code, don't expect everything to be properly commented, especially in my freshmen years. 
If you need help through any part or if you need to find out what was the assignment we were supposed to do, your best bet is probably to contact me and I will help you. 

## Master Degree Years (MSc)

### Main Projects
